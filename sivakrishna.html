    <h1>The Scientific Argument for Mastering One Thing at a Time </h1>

    <p style="font-size: x-large;">Many people, myself included, have multiple areas of life they would like to improve.
        For example, I would like to reach more people with my writing, to lift heavier weights at the gym, and to start
        practicing mindfulness more consistently. Those are just a few of the goals I find desirable and you probably
        have a long list yourself.</p>


    <p style="font-size: x-large;">The problem is, even if we are committed to working hard on our goals, <ins>our
            natural tendency is to revert back to our old habits at some point</ins>. Making a permanent lifestyle
        change is really difficult.</p>

    <p style="font-size: x-large;">Recently, I’ve come across a few research studies that (just maybe) will make these
        <ins>difficult lifestyle changes a little bit easier</ins>. As you’ll see, however, the approach to mastering
        many areas of life is somewhat <mark>counterintuitive.</mark></p>

    <p style="font-size: x-large;">If you want to master multiple habits and stick to them for good, <em>then you need
            to figure out how to be consistent </em>. <strong> How can you do that? </strong></p>

    <p style="font-size: x-large;">Well, <span style="color: rgb(243, 15, 15);">here is one of the most robust findings
            from psychology research</span> on how to actually follow through on your goals:</p>

    <h1>
        <p style="font-size: x-large;">What Happens When You Focus on One Thing</p>
    </h1>

    <p style="font-size: x-large;">Here is another science-based reason to focus on one thing at a time:</p>

    <p style="font-size: x-large;">When you begin practicing a new habit it requires a <ins>lot of conscious effort to
            remember to do it</ins>. After awhile, however, the pattern of behavior becomes easier. Eventually, your new
        habit becomes a normal routine and the process is more or <span style="color: coral;">less mindless and
            automatic.</span></p>

    <p style="font-size: x-large;">Researchers have a fancy term for this process called <strong>“automaticity.”
        </strong> <em>Automaticity is the ability to perform a behavior without thinking about each step, which allows
            the pattern to become automatic and habitual.</em></p>
